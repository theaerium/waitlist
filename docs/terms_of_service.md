# Aerium Terms of Service

**Last updated:** September 22nd, 2025

---

## 1) Acceptance of Terms

By creating an account, using the Aerium mobile app, depositing items, or using the Aerium prepaid debit card and banking‑as‑a‑service features (collectively, the **Service**), you agree to these Terms. If you do not agree, do not use the Service. These Terms are between you and **Senchi Technologies Inc.** (“**Senchi**”, “**we**”, “**us**”, "**our**'), which operates the Aerium application (“**Aerium**”). By agreeing to these Terms, you also agree to be bound by the following additional Aerium policies, which are incorporated by reference: Anti-Money Laundering Policy, Condition & Eligibility Guidelines, Photo Guidelines, and Privacy Policy. These policies may be updated from time to time, and your continued use of the Service constitutes acceptance of any updates.

## 2) Who We Are (Not a Bank)

Aerium, operated by **Senchi Technologies Inc.**, is a technology platform that (a) lets you deposit eligible physical items and receive a **spendable value** for use with a prepaid debit card, and (b) facilitates the sale of those items after an initial holding period. **Aerium is not a bank.** Card and account features are provided by third‑party financial institutions and service providers. Their agreements apply in addition to these Terms.

## 3) Eligibility

* **Age.** You must have reached the age of majority in your province or territory of residence in Canada to open an account and use the prepaid card. The age of majority is: **18** in Alberta, Manitoba, Ontario, Prince Edward Island, and Saskatchewan; **19** in British Columbia, New Brunswick, Newfoundland and Labrador, Nova Scotia, Northwest Territories, Nunavut, and Yukon.
* **Residence.** The Service is currently offered to residents of Canada **excluding Québec**. You represent you are opening the account for yourself (not for another person) and that you will keep your information accurate and up to date.
* **Business Use.** If you open or use an account for a business, you represent you have authority to bind that business. Additional terms may apply.

## 4) Account Registration & Security

* **Authentication.** Aerium uses one‑time “magic link” emails to authenticate your account. You are responsible for safeguarding access to your email and device(s). Anyone with access to your email inbox may be able to access your account.
* **Security.** Do not share links or allow others to access your account.
* **Shipping address required to spend.** You must provide and maintain a current, accurate shipping address in your account. You will not be permitted to spend any funds using the prepaid card until a valid shipping address is on file. You agree to promptly update your address before initiating any transactions if it changes. Notify us immediately at **[adam@joinaerium.com](mailto:adam@joinaerium.com)** if you suspect unauthorized use. Aerium may require additional security steps (e.g., 2‑step verification) and may disable, suspend, or terminate accounts at its discretion.
* **Electronic Communications & E‑Sign.** You agree to receive notices and disclosures electronically. You consent to use of electronic signatures and records for transactions with Aerium and its partners.

## 5) Overview of the Service

Aerium lets you deposit eligible items (e.g., clothing, accessories, footwear, bags, certain beauty products) and assigns a **Spendable Value** that you can use through a prepaid debit card. After a short holding period, Aerium may offer, list, or sell your item. If your item sells before you have spent its assigned value, you must ship the item in accordance with Section 8.

## 6) Item Deposits, Valuation, and Sale Authorization

* **Your promises.** When you deposit an item, you represent and warrant that:

  * The item is authentic, accurately described, and not stolen, counterfeit, illegal, recalled, or otherwise prohibited.
  * The item and photos meet our **[Condition & Eligibility Guidelines](joinaerium.com/codition-and-elegibility-guidelines)** and **[Photo Guidlines](joinaerium.com/photo-guidelines)** (published in the app/website and updated from time to time).
  * You accurately describe the item's condition and quality; deliberate misrepresentation (including overstating condition, omitting defects, or using deceptive or edited photos) **constitutes fraud** under these Terms.
* **Evaluation & Spendable Value.** Aerium (or our partners) may review your item information and assign a **Spendable Value**. This value is an advance of funds made available for prepaid card use, separate from the ultimate sale price. You are not entitled to the difference in spendable value and ultimate sales price. Aerium may adjust or revoke a Spendable Value if we discover errors, suspected fraud, or ineligible items.
* **Eligibility updates.** Aerium may modify or discontinue what qualifies as an eligible item and may update the **[Condition & Eligibility Guidelines](joinaerium.com/codition-and-elegibility-guidelines)** and **[Photo Guidlines](joinaerium.com/photo-guidelines)** at any time **without prior notice**, effective upon posting in the app or website. For items already deposited but not yet sold, Aerium may cancel listings, reverse Spendable Value, and return or require return of items that become ineligible.
* **Holding period.** Beginning **6 hours** after an item is deposited, you **authorize Aerium** to list, market, and sell the item. Aerium may adjust this timeframe with prior notice.
* **Right to withdraw items.** Before an item is sold, you may withdraw it from Aerium via the app. Once an item is sold, you can no longer withdraw it and must ship it per Section 8.
* **Title & risk.** You retain title to an item until it is sold or it's value spent, except as otherwise stated in these Terms. Risk of loss passes to the carrier when you tender the package using the provided label.
* **Pricing & sale process.** You authorize Aerium to determine pricing, promotional strategies, and sales channels for your item, including bundling, discounts, and fees.
* **Counterfeits & misdescription.** If an item is counterfeit, stolen, restricted, or materially misdescribed, Aerium may cancel transactions, reverse Spendable Value, charge your balance (or payment method), and ban your account. We may cooperate with law enforcement.

## 7) Balances, Fees, Holds, and Set‑Off

* **Not a deposit account.** Any **Balance** shown in the app is informational and reflects prepaid value available through our partners. Aerium itself does not accept deposits and does not hold your funds.
* **Fees & limits.** Fees, spending limits, cash access, and other features are set by the card issuer and partners (see Section 9). Aerium may add or change Aerium‑specific fees with prior notice in the app or by email.
* **Holds & reserves.** We may place holds, reserves, or spending limits on your Balance (or negative balances) to manage risk, fraud, or disputes.
* **Set‑off & collection.** If you fail to ship after a sale, send the wrong item, a buyer wins a dispute/chargeback, or fees are owed, you authorize Aerium to **debit your Balance**, reverse Spendable Value, charge a payment method you provide, and/or engage collection efforts. We may also reduce future Spendable Values and withhold payouts to satisfy amounts you owe.

## 8) Shipping & Fulfilment

* **Labels & timing.** When your item sells, Aerium will provide a prepaid shipping label and instructions.
* **Address accuracy.** You must keep your shipping address accurate and up to date. If you ship to an outdated or incorrect address, you are responsible for any resulting loss, delay, or additional costs. We may disable spending or fulfilment if no valid address is on file. **You must ship the item within 48 hours** of receiving the label (or a shorter time shown in the app). Failure to ship on time may result in reversal of Spendable Value and additional fees.
* **Packaging & proof.** You are responsible for secure packaging. Keep proof of drop‑off and tracking. If you do not use the provided label, you are responsible for any loss, delay, or added cost.
* **Lost/damaged in transit.** For shipments using Aerium‑provided labels, Aerium will assist with carrier claims. Our liability is limited to amounts recovered from the carrier and, in any case, will not exceed the Spendable Value for the item unless required by law.
* **Returns & SNAD.** If a buyer claims an item is significantly not as described (e.g., counterfeit, wrong item, materially different condition), Aerium may require a return to you or to Aerium, refund the buyer, and **debit your Balance** for the refund, return shipping, and related costs.

## 9) Prepaid Card & BaaS Partners

* **Issuer & program manager.** The Aerium prepaid debit card is issued and managed by [Reloadly](reloadly.com). **The cardholder agreement governs your card use and will be presented at signup.**
* **KYC/AML.** Our partners may require identity verification and screening. If you do not pass required checks or fail to provide information promptly, we may limit, suspend, or close your account and reverse Spendable Value.
* **Funds & insurance.** Funds available for prepaid card use are held with our partners. Coverage by the Canada Deposit Insurance Corporation (CDIC) may depend on the issuer and program design. Where applicable, issuer disclosures will explain eligibility.
* **Limits & prohibited uses.** Card features, load limits, ATM access, foreign transactions, and prohibited uses (e.g., unlawful transactions, gambling, cash equivalents) are governed by the cardholder agreement and network rules.

## 10) Prohibited Items & Conduct

* **Prohibited items include:** stolen goods; counterfeits; weapons or regulated accessories; hazardous materials; recalled items; items infringing third‑party IP; items violating law or platform policies.
* **Platform integrity.** You must not interfere with the Service, scrape data, or use bots/automated tools without our written permission. Attempts to hack or overload the Service may result in a lifetime ban and legal action.

## 11) Fraud Review and Suspicious Activity

Aerium may investigate, place holds, freeze accounts, and report activity to partners or authorities where we suspect fraud, money laundering, sanctions issues, or abuse. We may retain or share information as required by law and our agreements with partners. For clarity, **misrepresenting the condition or quality of an item** is treated as fraud and may result in reversal of Spendable Value, chargebacks, account bans (including lifetime bans), and referral to law enforcement.

**Aerium reserves the right to remove items, suspend users, and or pursue recourse to the fullest extent of the law when deemed necessary by Aerium leadership.** 

Aerium's anti-money laundeirng (AML) policies are outlined in the **[Aerium Anti-Money Laundering Policy](joinaerium.com/anti-money-laundering)

## 12) Intellectual Property & Content License

The Service, including software, design, and logos, is owned by Aerium or its licensors. You may not copy, modify, or distribute the Service except as allowed by law. By submitting content (e.g., photos, descriptions), you grant Aerium a non‑exclusive, worldwide, royalty‑free license to host, display, and distribute that content to provide the Service.

## 13) Data Ownership & Privacy

* **Your data.** You retain ownership of your personal information, account data, and item descriptions. However, you acknowledge that certain data (e.g., transaction records, fraud prevention data) may be shared with our partners as necessary to provide the Service.
* **Usage data.** Aerium may collect, use, and analyze aggregated, anonymized data about service usage, user behavior, and platform performance to improve the service, develop new features, and for business analytics.
* **Data retention.** We retain your data as long as your account is active and as required by law, our agreements with partners, and our business needs. Upon account closure, we may retain certain data for legal, regulatory, or business purposes.
* **Data portability.** You may request a copy of your personal data in a portable format by contacting us through the in-app customer support chat or at **[adam@joinaerium.com](mailto:adam@joinaerium.com)**. We will provide this data within 30 days, subject to verification of your identity and any legal restrictions.
* **Data deletion.** You may request deletion of your personal data, subject to our legal obligations to retain certain information (e.g., transaction records, fraud prevention data, regulatory requirements). We will delete data that we are not legally required to retain within 30 days of your request.
* **Privacy policy.** Our collection, use, and protection of your data is further detailed in our **[Privacy Policy](joinaerium.com/privacy-policy), which is incorporated by reference into these Terms.

## 14) Third‑Party Services

The Service may link to or integrate with third‑party services (email, identity verification, card networks, BaaS providers). We are not responsible for third‑party services or their content. Their terms and privacy policies apply.

## 15) Termination

You may stop using the Service at any time. We may suspend or terminate your account (and access to the card) if you violate these Terms, fail KYC/AML checks, or present risk to Aerium, partners, or users. Upon termination, you remain responsible for shipped/unsold items, fees, chargebacks, and amounts owed. We may retain information as required by law and our policies.

## 16) Disclaimers

The Service is provided **“as is”** without warranties of any kind, express or implied, including merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, title, and non‑infringement. Some provinces do not allow disclaimers of implied warranties; in those provinces, the foregoing applies to the maximum extent permitted by law.

## 17) Limitation of Liability

To the maximum extent permitted by law, Aerium and its affiliates will not be liable for indirect, incidental, special, consequential, exemplary, or punitive damages; or lost profits, revenues, data, goodwill, or business interruption, whether based in contract, tort, or other theory—even if advised of the possibility. Our total liability for any claim relating to the Service will not exceed the greater of: (a) the amounts you paid to Aerium in the 3 months preceding the event giving rise to the claim, or (b) CAD \$100. This limitation does not apply to liability that cannot be excluded under applicable law.

## 18) Indemnification

You will indemnify and hold Aerium, its affiliates, and their officers, directors, employees, and agents harmless from any claims, losses, damages, liabilities, costs, and expenses (including legal fees) arising out of: (a) your items, descriptions, or conduct; (b) your breach of these Terms or applicable law; or (c) infringement of third‑party rights.

## 19) Governing Law & Venue

These Terms are governed by the laws of **Ontario, Canada**, without regard to conflict‑of‑law rules, and you irrevocably submit to the jurisdiction of the courts in **Toronto, Ontario**.

## 20) Changes to the Service and Terms

We may modify the Service and update these Terms from time to time. Material changes will be communicated through the app or by email and become effective on the date stated. Your continued use after changes become effective constitutes acceptance.

## 21) Miscellaneous

* **Assignment.** You may not assign your rights or obligations without our consent. We may assign these Terms.
* **Force Majeure.** We are not liable for delays or failures due to events beyond our reasonable control.
* **Severability; No waiver.** If any provision is unenforceable, it will be replaced with an enforceable term that comes closest to the original intent. Failure to enforce is not a waiver.
* **Entire Agreement.** These Terms, along with the cardholder agreement and any policies referenced in‑app, form the entire agreement between you and Aerium regarding the Service.
