# Aerium Privacy Policy

Last updated: September 22, 2025

### Who we are
- Aerium is operated by Senchi Technologies Inc. We provide a platform that lets you deposit eligible items, receive a spendable value via a prepaid card. Aerium sells the deposited items after a holding period. We use third‑party providers for authentication, payments, card issuing, cloud hosting, and fraud prevention.

### What we collect
- Account and profile: email, name, shipping address (required to spend), and other details you provide.
- Authentication: session tokens and related data from our auth provider (e.g., Stytch) to secure your account.
- Photos and item data: images you upload (including embedded metadata like EXIF timestamps), item titles/descriptions/attributes, and quality or category you select.
- Derived anti‑fraud data: non‑reversible image fingerprints (e.g., sha256, dHash), similarity scores, duplicate flags, AI analysis results, and logs associated with fraud checks.
- Device and usage: app/browser type, device identifiers, IP address, timestamps, and interaction events to keep the service reliable and secure.
- Payments and card activity: limited transaction metadata and outcomes from our card and payment partners (we do not store full card numbers on our servers).

### How we use data
- Provide and operate the service (e.g., item deposit, valuation, listing, and sale processes).
- Secure accounts and prevent fraud and abuse (authentication, duplicate and manipulation detection, sanctions/AML checks, and investigation support).
- Communicate with you (transactional emails, support, service announcements). You can opt out of non‑essential marketing.
- Improve and develop features (quality, performance, reliability, and safety of our systems).
- Comply with law, card network and banking‑partner requirements, and enforce our Terms.

### Processing of photos
- We may read embedded EXIF timestamps to verify photos comply with [Aerium Photo Guidelines](/legal/photo-guidelines).
- We may compute and store image fingerprints to verify photos comply with [Aerium Photo Guidelines](/legal/photo-guidelines).
- We may use third‑party (e.g. Google, SightEngine) tools to verify photos comply with [Aerium Photo Guidelines](/legal/photo-guidelines).

### Sharing with third parties
- Authentication and security: Stytch (account/session); fraud tools and content safety vendors.
- Cloud storage/hosting: e.g., AWS S3 for image storage and presigned access.
- Payments and card issuing: Reloadly for the prepaid card and payment features.
- Shipping and logistics: when needed to fulfill item sales or returns.
- Compliance and legal: regulators, law enforcement, and partners when required by law, contract, or to protect our users and service.
All vendors are bound by agreements limiting their processing to the services they provide to us.

### International data transfers
- We may store or process data outside your province or outside Canada (including the United States). We take steps to protect your information consistent with this Policy and applicable laws.

### Retention
- We retain account, transaction, photo, and anti‑fraud data for as long as needed to provide the service, meet legal/partner obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce agreements. Certain AML records may be kept for at least five years or longer where required.

### Your choices and rights
- Access, correction, deletion: You can request access to or deletion of your personal information, subject to legal and contractual limits (e.g., AML retention).
- Marketing preferences: You can opt out of non‑essential emails.
- Cookies and device permissions: You can control certain settings via your device or browser.
To make a request, contact us through the in-app support chat or at the email below. We may need to verify your identity.

### Children’s privacy
- The service is not intended for individuals under the age of majority in their province/territory. We do not knowingly collect personal information from minors.

### Security
- We use administrative, technical, and physical safeguards appropriate to the sensitivity of the data, including encryption in transit, access controls, and logging. No system is perfectly secure; please protect your account and report suspected issues promptly.

### Changes to this Policy
- We may update this Policy as our service evolves. Material changes will be communicated in‑app or by email where appropriate.

### Contact
- Questions or privacy requests: through the in-app Aerium support chat or at [adam@joinaerium.com](mailto:adam@joinaerium.com)
