# Aerium Anti‑Money Laundering (AML) Policy

Last updated: September 22, 2025

### Overview
- Aerium (operated by Senchi Technologies Inc.) provides a platform to deposit eligible items and receive a spendable value via a prepaid debit card. Aerium sells the deposited items after a holding period. We are not a bank. Card, account, and certain payment services are provided by regulated third‑party partners. Aerium maintains a risk‑based AML program consistent with applicable Canadian requirements and industry best practices.

### Objectives
- Prevent the platform from being used for money laundering, terrorist financing, fraud, or other financial crime.
- Detect, investigate, and report suspicious activity consistent with applicable laws and our partner bank requirements.
- Maintain governance, controls, and records proportionate to the risks of our products and geographies.

### Program components
- Customer identification (KYC): We may collect and verify information such as name, date of birth, address, email/phone, and device signals. We may use third‑party services to authenticate sessions and prevent account takeover.
- Sanctions and watchlists: We screen customers and certain transactions against applicable sanctions and watchlists. We do not provide services to sanctioned persons or for prohibited end‑uses.
- Ongoing monitoring: We monitor accounts, deposits, and card activity for anomalies (e.g., suspicious velocity, structuring patterns, rapid deposit/spend with unrelated items, unusually high dispute rates, cross‑account coordination, or attempts to bypass photo and item‑eligibility controls).
- Fraud and content safety: Photos are checked for duplicates, mismatches with item details, and signs of editing / manipulation using internal tools and third‑party vendors where applicable.
- Enhanced due diligence (EDD): We may request additional information or documentation for higher‑risk activity (e.g., government ID, proof of address, source of funds, item provenance).
- Controls & limitations: We may apply holds, spending limits, delays, or reversals while we review an account or activity. We may decline deposits, payments, or account actions that present unacceptable risk.
- Recordkeeping: We retain KYC data, activity logs, investigation notes, and relevant communications for the periods required by law and our partners (typically up to five years, or longer if required for disputes, audits, or legal obligations).

### Prohibited uses
- Laundering proceeds of crime, terrorist financing, or evasion of sanctions or export controls.
- Selling stolen, counterfeit, or illegal items; using Aerium to fence goods.
- Structuring activity to avoid reviews or limits; layering funds through rapid multiple accounts; using synthetic identities.
- Using anonymizing tools or obfuscation intended to defeat our controls.

### When we report or restrict
- We may file reports with applicable authorities or with our financial partners, freeze or restrict accounts, reverse deposits, or block transactions without prior notice where required or appropriate.
- We may contact you for clarification or documentation. Failure to respond may lead to delays or account restrictions.

### How AML interacts with your data
- We may process your photos’ metadata (e.g., EXIF timestamps) and compute non‑reversible image fingerprints to detect duplicates or misuse.
- We may share necessary data with service providers (authentication, fraud, cloud hosting, card issuing, compliance tools) under contracts that limit use to providing their services.

### Contact
- To report suspected misuse or ask AML questions, contact support through the in-app support chat or email [adam@joinaerium.com](mailto:adam@joinaerium.com). For emergencies, also contact local law enforcement.

**Aerium reserves the right to remove items, suspend users, and or pursue recourse to the fullest extent of the law when deemed necessary by Aerium leadership.**
